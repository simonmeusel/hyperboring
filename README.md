# Hyperboring

Extension for Hyper which `only` gives you `wow` mode. Basicly [`Hyperpower`](https://github.com/zeit/hyperpower) but the normal particle effects are removed, just `wow` mode remains!

## How to use

Install [Hyper](https://hyper.is) and add `hyperboring`
to `plugins` in `~/.hyper.js`.

## Credits

Fork of [`Hyperpower`](https://github.com/zeit/hyperpower) which is based on [`power-mode`](https://atom.io/packages/power-mode) and
